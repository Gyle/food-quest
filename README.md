    A PWA project for recording your best food spots

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The idea is to have an easily accessable app for recording food places you have been to for keeping a personal diary of what you determine to be the go to food spots.

This is presented in a maps format, focusing on recording food spots as markers to see at glance which food spots you have been to.

When this proof of concept project gets completed the functionality may extend to adding a social network to view where your friends have been (if they choose to make their visited spots public).
